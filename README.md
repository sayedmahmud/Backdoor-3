## Spyware
The spyware get's all the **Passwords Saved in Chrome** and the system details like: RAM, Processor, Type of machine, Public-IP, and using the report method
it returns all of this data.
With a little bit of knowledge you can make the spyware to send this data via EMAIL, and because this spyware is undetectable, you can find out a lot of Information about someone with this script. (Don't do that if the person doesn't know, ILLEGAL).
