# Backdoor
**his is an advanced backdoor, created with Python.**
The backdoor contains a ton of options like:

Download, uploading, add/remove to startup, enable/disable task manager
launch + delete + read + edit files, screenshot, sysinfo, idle time
send messages, show list of processes running, lock + shotdown system...

The Spyware was desinged to work with the Backdoor, but with a few additions, like E-Mailing the data it can become a very powerfull Spyware.
Curerntly it steals all the passwords saved in Chrome, and the system information: RAM, processor, system type, ip...

To use the backdoor, you need to change the IP address in backdoor to your **PRIVATE IP** and in server to your **PRIVATE IP** address, and then start server and wait for connection.
Send to someone the backdoor, and when they start it, you should get a connection.

**If you want someone to connect outside your local network**:
Chagne the ip address in backdoor, to your public one, and in the router settings make sure you forward it to your private one.
