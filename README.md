To use the backdoor, you need to change the IP address in backdoor to your **PRIVATE IP** and in server to your **PRIVATE IP** address, and then start server and wait for connection.

Chagne the ip address in the backdoor, to your public one, and in the router settings make sure you forward it to your private one.
